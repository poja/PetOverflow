PetOverflow
===========

This is a Q&A type site, focusing on pets and animals.

Important notes:
 - The program has an option to initiate a sample database, if the database is empty.
   This option is turned on by default. To turn it off, see the class petoverflow.Config.
 - There is an extra feature called extended notifications.
   Users who choose to enable this feature will be sent SMS notifications when 
   someone answers their PetOverflow question. Do not worry, your phone number will not be kept
   anywhere except for the local (offline) database.
 - The D3.js library was used to create a tag cloud for popular topics, and to create
   a bar graph showing the PetOverflow leaders and their ratings.
 - A search feature was added, enabling question search and topic search.
